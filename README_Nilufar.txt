README

1. I coded for the dual ported SRAM cell in the file named OpenRAM/compiler/cell_8T.py
 
2. The Unit test is in the file located in OpenRAM/compiler/_04_cell_8T_test.py

3. The code generates the layout and passes the LVS test for freepdk45 technology. 
   I redesigned the positions of the transistors as it was giving short circuit errors for the LVS test.
